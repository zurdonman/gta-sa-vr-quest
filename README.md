# GTA San Andreas VR for Quest — Source Kit

Version `0.2.0 alpha`. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

This repository contains the source code and build/install tools for the GTA
San Andreas VR Quest mod. It does **not** contain GTA San Andreas, Rockstar
assets, the sound mod, a prebuilt APK, native binaries, or signing keys.

## University monolithic build

This source kit also supports a legally owned, self-contained/offline GTA SA
2.11.311 APK supplied for a university project. Use the complete monolithic APK
as `-GamePackage`, pass `-AllowUnofficialSource`, and provide the supported
PS2-style audio archive as `-AudioSource`:

```powershell
.\tools\build-and-install.ps1 `
  -GamePackage "C:\path\to\gta_sa_2.11.311.apk" `
  -AudioSource "C:\path\to\gta-sa-ps2-style-mod-pack_1786856007_737162.7z" `
  -AllowUnofficialSource
```

For a one-click Windows build and install, run
`BUILD_MONOLITHIC_ALPHA_V5.bat`. You can drag the monolithic APK and the audio
archive onto the batch file, or run it with two arguments:

```bat
BUILD_MONOLITHIC_ALPHA_V5.bat "C:\path\to\gta_sa_2.11.311.apk" "C:\path\to\gta-sa-ps2-style-mod-pack_1786856007_737162.7z"
```

The script invokes the normal source build, adds `-AllowUnofficialSource`,
signs and aligns the resulting Alpha v5 APK, and installs/publishes it when an
authorized Quest is connected. Use `-BuildOnly` after the two paths if you want
to build without touching a device.

For a small offline demonstration, `release\Alpha-v5` contains the validated
APK and the Quest payload used for testing. Connect a Quest with Developer Mode
and USB debugging enabled, then run `release\Alpha-v5\INSTALL_ALPHA_V5.bat`.
The installer uses the APK and payload already included there; it does not
download or redistribute GTA data.

## Requirements

- Your own installed copy of GTA San Andreas from Google Play, version
  `2.11.311`, ARM64. Export the complete Play split set into one directory or
  archive. A single `base.apk` is not sufficient.
- A separate archive or extracted directory containing the supported PS2-style
  sound mod. The recommended input is the exact file
  `gta-sa-ps2-style-mod-pack_1786856007_737162.7z`. Download it from the
  [LibertyCity mod page](https://libertycity.net/files/gta-san-andreas-ios-android/241069-gta-sa-classic-avanced-mod-pack.html),
  then select **Original plan mod pack** dated **16 August 2026** (1.41 GB).
  Do **not** select the newer **CLASSIC ADVANCED v1.0** download on the same
  page; its audio banks are different and are not supported. The wizard copies
  only 59 verified files from `CONFIG`, `SFX`, and `STREAMS`; CLEO scripts,
  saves, models, launch configuration, and all other mod-pack content are
  ignored.
  In the original Play split set, `assets/audio` contains only the service
  `config` subset. The required `SFX` and `STREAMS` data is not present in the
  APKs, so seeing that directory in an archive browser or simply unpacking the
  original APK is not enough.
- Windows 10/11, Linux x86_64, or macOS. Internet access is required for the
  initial toolchain download. Installing on Quest also requires Developer Mode
  and authorized USB debugging.
- Approximately 15 GB of free disk space on the computer and 6 GB on Quest.

## Exporting your own Google Play APK set

Use an Android phone or tablet on which your legally owned Google Play copy of
GTA San Andreas `2.11.311` is currently installed. Do not download an APK from a
third-party APK site: the build wizard accepts only the original Google Play
certificate and rejects modified, merged, or re-signed packages.

### One-click Windows export

The easiest Windows method does not require installing ADB or typing commands:

1. On the phone/tablet containing the Google Play game, open **Settings > About
   phone > Software information** and tap **Build number** seven times. Then
   open **Settings > System > Developer options** and enable **USB debugging**.
2. Connect it by USB, unlock it, and approve the debugging prompt.
3. Double-click `EXPORT_PLAY_APKS.bat`.
4. Keep the device unlocked until the export completes.
5. Disconnect the phone/tablet, run `BUILD_AND_INSTALL.bat`, and select the
   exported `base.apk`. The builder automatically includes its sibling splits.

`base.apk` is the correct filename. Do not rename it, and keep every exported
`split_*.apk` in the same folder. Seeing the phone in Windows File Explorer only
confirms an MTP file connection; the exporter waits up to two minutes for the
separate USB-debugging authorization and continues automatically once approved.
The complete export must include both `split_config.arm64_v8a.apk` and
`split_data_main.apk`. If Google Play installed a different CPU variant, export
from a real 64-bit ARM Android phone/tablet rather than an emulator or Windows
Android subsystem.

The exporter downloads Google's pinned Platform Tools itself, verifies their
SHA-256, checks GTA SA version `2.11.311` (`4234641`), exports every installed
split, verifies the resulting files, and opens the finished folder.

### Advanced Linux or macOS export

Windows users should use `EXPORT_PLAY_APKS.bat`; no manual PowerShell or ADB
commands are needed. Advanced Linux or macOS users with Google's official
[SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools)
can use:

```bash
destination="$PWD/GTA-SA-Play-export"
mkdir -p "$destination"
apk_paths="$(adb shell pm path com.rockstargames.gtasa | tr -d '\r' | sed 's/^package://')"
test -n "$apk_paths" || { echo 'GTA San Andreas is not installed'; exit 1; }
for remote_path in $apk_paths; do
  adb pull "$remote_path" "$destination/" || exit 1
done
```

The resulting directory must contain the base APK, the ARM64 split, the
`data_main`/assets split, and any locale or density splits returned by
`pm path`. Do not rename, merge, modify, or re-sign these input files. Select
the complete `GTA-SA-Play-export` directory when the build wizard asks for the
original game package. The wizard performs the final version, ABI, game-library,
split, and official-signer checks before building or accessing Quest.

If the Android device refuses direct `adb pull` access to its installed APKs,
use an on-device split-APK backup/export tool that preserves every installed APK
unchanged, then select the exported `.apks` archive or directory. The same strict
certificate and content checks still apply.

## Quick start on Windows

1. Double-click `BUILD_AND_INSTALL.bat`.
2. Select the APK, archive, or directory containing the complete original-game
   export.
3. Select `gta-sa-ps2-style-mod-pack_1786856007_737162.7z` or its extracted
   audio directory. On the LibertyCity page this is the **Original plan mod
   pack**, not **CLASSIC ADVANCED v1.0**.
4. Connect the Quest and approve USB debugging inside the headset.
5. Review the installation summary.

On the first run, type `ACCEPT` when asked only if you agree to the Google
Android SDK licenses. The wizard then handles sdkmanager's repetitive `y/N`
prompts. Dependency downloads report transferred size, total size, speed, and
ETA every five seconds; a connection that receives no data for 90 seconds fails
with a retry message instead of appearing to hang indefinitely.

The wizard validates both inputs and completes the build on the computer before
changing anything on Quest. It installs the APK set, deploys `data_main`, audio,
and VR hands, verifies the resulting hashes, and leaves the game stopped. It
never launches the game automatically.

During validation, the wizard also generates the distant aircraft HLOD from
the selected, verified retail `data_main` split. Generated geometry stays in
the ignored per-run build directory; the repository ships only the open source
generator and runtime renderer.

The original Play APKs must be signed with a personal key. A first installation
may therefore require removal of an installed copy that uses a different
signature. The wizard backs up accessible saves and settings first and **always
asks for separate confirmation** before removal. Keep the personal signing key
stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GTASAVRBuilder\signing`; it is required for updates.

### Build only, without connecting a Quest

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File .\tools\build-and-install.ps1 `
  -GamePackage "D:\Backups\GTA-SA-Play-export" `
  -AudioSource "D:\Mods\gta-sa-ps2-style-mod-pack_1786856007_737162.7z" `
  -BuildOnly
```

The output and complete `build-manifest.json` are written to the run directory
under `C:\SAVRBuild`, or under the directory passed through `-WorkDir`.

## Linux and macOS

On Linux x86_64, install Bash, Python 3.10 or newer, `curl`, `tar` with xz
support, and `unzip`. Installing on Quest also requires working USB access and
appropriate Android udev rules. macOS requires the equivalent command-line
tools and USB access. The wizard downloads the pinned JDK 21, Android SDK, and
other build tools when needed.

Run the interactive wizard with:

```bash
bash BUILD_AND_INSTALL.sh
```

The recommended `.7z` is extracted with the automatically downloaded, pinned
7-Zip `26.02`. Both the archive and executable are verified by SHA-256. A
system-wide 7-Zip installation and manual extraction are not required.

To build and validate the output without connecting a Quest:

```bash
bash BUILD_AND_INSTALL.sh \
  --game-package "$HOME/Backups/GTA-SA-Play-export" \
  --audio-source "$HOME/Downloads/gta-sa-ps2-style-mod-pack_1786856007_737162.7z" \
  --work-dir "$HOME/SAVRBuild" \
  --build-only
```

Each run receives a separate `~/SAVRBuild/runs/<run-id>` directory, or
`<work-dir>/runs/<run-id>`, so stale CMake caches are never reused. The
persistent signing key is stored at
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/gtasavr-builder/signing/savr.keystore`, or at
`~/.local/share/gtasavr-builder/signing/savr.keystore` when `XDG_DATA_HOME` is
unset. Do not delete or replace this key; it is required to update an installed
build.

If the Quest appears as `unauthorized`, approve USB debugging inside the headset
and reconnect the cable. For an `offline` device, restart ADB and reconnect it.
A permissions error or missing device on Linux usually means that Android udev
rules must be installed or corrected before signing in again or reconnecting
the Quest.

Run `bash BUILD_AND_INSTALL.sh --help` for all options. Before its first Quest
mutation, the wizard prints the selected device, APK and payload sizes, signing
key path, and complete action list, then requires the word `INSTALL`.
Automation requires both `--non-interactive` and `--yes`; destructive removal
of a package with a foreign signature is never automated. ZIP executable bits
are not required because every internal shell script is invoked through Bash.
After installation, the wizard leaves GTA SA stopped and never launches it.

## Resetting VR settings on Quest

Remove old player overrides after compiled calibration defaults change:

- Windows: double-click `RESET_VR_SETTINGS.bat`.
- Linux/macOS: run `bash RESET_VR_SETTINGS.sh`.

The script selects the connected Quest, prints the exact plan, and asks for the
word `RESET`. It then stops GTA SA, removes only the nine exact VR settings
files listed in [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md), and verifies the result. Saves,
`audio`, `vrhands`, game data, APKs, and performance CSV files remain intact.
The game is not launched; new compiled defaults take effect after the next
manual start. Version 0.2.0 embeds the author's release-Quest menu,
weapon, HUD, holster, and vehicle calibration as its defaults. The sole quality
override is the eye-buffer resolution, which resets to `100%`.

For automation, use `-Yes -NonInteractive` in PowerShell or
`--yes --non-interactive` in Bash. With multiple devices, specify
`-Serial`/`--serial`.

### Exporting VR settings for support or calibration sharing

Windows users can run:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File .\tools\export-savr-settings.ps1
```

The helper copies the current VR `.ini` files into a timestamped folder on the
PC. It deliberately excludes saves, logs, screenshots, game assets, and the raw
Quest serial number. Add `-DrivingOnly` when only vehicle calibration is needed.

## HD weapon models (optional)

The mod can swap the low-poly weapons for higher-detail models. The models are
**not** part of this kit — you download a community weapon pack yourself and an
installer builds it into the game's own format and copies it to the headset.
Nothing in the game APK is changed: the models live in the app's files folder
and load only while the option is on, so you can turn them off any time.

1. Install and run the mod once (`BUILD_AND_INSTALL.bat`) so Python and adb are
   available and the game has been started at least once.
2. Download a compatible mobile weapon model pack containing the weapon `.dff`
   files (for example an "Original HD Weapons" mobile pack). The models are
   third-party content and are intentionally not redistributed by this kit.
3. Connect the Quest and double-click **`INSTALL_HD_WEAPONS.bat`**. Drag the
   downloaded pack into the window when it asks, and press Enter. The installer
   builds the weapon image + textures and copies everything to the headset on
   its own, then verifies the files landed.
   - You can drag in **either the archive** (`.zip`/`.7z`) **or an
     already-extracted folder**. If it says it can't open a `.7z`/`.rar`
     (no 7‑Zip installed), just extract the pack yourself — right-click →
     Extract — and drag the extracted **folder** in instead.
4. Put on the headset, open the VR menu → **GRAPHICS** → set
   **WEAPON MODELS** to **HD** (the row shows a **[RESTART]** tag), then fully
   close and reopen the game. Re-open GRAPHICS: the tag is gone once HD is
   active. If the row shows **< NO FILES >**, the payload did not land — rerun
   the installer.

To go back to the stock weapons, set **WEAPON MODELS** to **ORIGINAL** (a
restart applies it), or delete the `files/hdweapons` and
`files/texdb/hdweapons` folders on the headset.

Notes:

- Each weapon keeps a **separate** grip/aim calibration per model set, so tuning
  the HD models never disturbs your original-weapon calibration, and vice versa.
  Sensible HD defaults ship compiled in, so most models are placed correctly out
  of the box.
- A couple of very large models in some packs are skipped automatically (they
  exceed the game's streaming buffer) and keep their original model; everything
  else swaps. Prefer optimised, lower-poly packs for best VR performance.
- Advanced: `tools/install-hdweapons.ps1 -Archive <path-or-folder>` runs it
  head-less, and `tools/build_hdweapons.py <pack-folder> --out <dir>` builds the
  payload without pushing.

## Supported original game

The public wizard fails closed and accepts only the verified Google Play ARM64
release:

- package: `com.rockstargames.gtasa`
- version: `2.11.311` (`versionCode 4234641`)
- official signer SHA-256:
  `FF5B7B6A083FE5994E3306B30AE19D311951D019A8DE7C3E6914F0E06D130A13`
- `libGame.so` SHA-256:
  `4C6A7445E30B27AFDDA781302E4DB9BAC89C28FC1181B68B1EEF16F84D6A282E`

Locale and density splits may vary; the wizard identifies them from their
manifests rather than filenames. Directories and `.zip`, `.apks`, `.xapk`,
`.apkm`, `.7z`, and `.rar` archives are supported. On Linux and macOS, supported
`.7z` and `.rar` inputs are handled by the pinned, verified 7-Zip downloaded by
the wizard.

## Credits

The VR layer is written independently against the retail mobile game binary,
but understanding the original San Andreas behaviour is much easier thanks to
the community reverse-engineering of the PC version,
[gta-reversed / gta-reversed-modern](https://github.com/gta-reversed/gta-reversed-modern),
which we consult as a behavioural reference. Thanks to its authors and
contributors. Full attribution is in [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).

## Validation boundary

The source kit validates sources, builds, signatures, APK payloads, and file
copying. This does not prove that the game works correctly inside a headset.
After installation, the player starts GTA SA manually and performs the visual
and runtime validation.
